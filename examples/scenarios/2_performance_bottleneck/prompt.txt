My API responses are very slow, especially for certain endpoints.

Can you profile the application and identify the performance bottlenecks?

The app is running on http://localhost:8001 with these endpoints:
- GET /primes?limit=50000  (very slow)
- GET /fibonacci?n=40      (very slow)

I've started it with --inspect on port 9229.
