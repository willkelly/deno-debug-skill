My API is really slow and I can't figure out why. The /primes endpoint takes forever to respond, even for relatively small requests. Users are complaining about timeouts.

The app is running on http://localhost:8001 with these endpoints:
  GET /primes?limit=10000  - Find primes up to limit (this is the slow one)
  GET /fibonacci?n=35      - Calculate fibonacci number (also slow)
  GET /health              - Health check (this one's fine)

I thought it might be database queries, but we're not even using a database here - it's just computation. Can you profile this and figure out what's taking so long?

Example slow request:
  curl 'http://localhost:8001/primes?limit=50000'

(I've started the app with --inspect on port 9229)
