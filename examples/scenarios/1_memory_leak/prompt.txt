I'm seeing a memory leak in my Deno app. Every time users upload a file, the memory usage grows and never comes back down. After about 20-30 uploads, the process crashes with an out-of-memory error.

The app is running on http://localhost:8000 with a /upload endpoint. You can trigger an upload with:
  curl 'http://localhost:8000/upload?size=50000000'

I expected the memory to stabilize after each upload completes, but it just keeps climbing. Can you investigate what's causing this?

(I've started the app with --inspect on port 9229)
