My Deno app's memory keeps growing with each file upload and never gets released.

Can you investigate what's causing the leak?

The app is running on http://localhost:8000 and has a /upload endpoint.
You can trigger uploads with: curl 'http://localhost:8000/upload?size=50000000'

I've started it with --inspect on port 9229.
