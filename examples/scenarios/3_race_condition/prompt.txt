My Deno app has async operations that sometimes complete in the wrong order, causing inconsistent behavior.

Can you investigate the race conditions?

The app is running on http://localhost:8002 with these endpoints:
- POST /order        (creates orders but they don't save properly)
- POST /update       (concurrent updates cause data loss)
- POST /batch        (processes in unpredictable order)
- GET  /orders       (view current state)

I've started it with --inspect on port 9229.
